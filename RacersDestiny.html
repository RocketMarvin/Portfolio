        <h3>This was my most recent project where I made a race game </h3>
        <p> This was my most recent project wich I made a race game with AI bots in the game that look for checkpoints to make a lap and let the 
            laps count so you know if you lost the race or won the game. This was the most difficult because I needed to learn how to make an AI
            which knows where to go, the map designing was most of the fun because I could let my creative side go
