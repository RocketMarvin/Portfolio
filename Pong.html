        <h1>Pong With A Twist</h1>
        <h3>This was my first project where I made a pong game with some of my own twists </h3>
        <p>This was my first game ever greated, it was where I started to learn about starting to write code in my case it was C#. Most of what I was 
            learning how to activate program and how to connect it with a object. In the beginning I had no idea what I was doing but after a time 
            I started to understand how worked and I could do the basics on my own
